India_Mission_79 from India served as a Lunar sample return. Engineers used this
flight to validate hardware, improve communications, and gather operational
experience for follow-up missions. Some objectives were met while others were
not; the partial success still yielded scientific returns and engineering
lessons. Onboard instruments typically included imagers, spectrometers,
magnetometers, and sometimes landers or rovers for in-situ study.
