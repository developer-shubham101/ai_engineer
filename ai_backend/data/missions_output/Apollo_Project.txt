Project Apollo's primary goal was to land a man on the Moon and return him
safely to the Earth by the end of the 1960s. This objective was set by President
John F. Kennedy in 1961. The project was a massive undertaking, involving
hundreds of thousands of people and costing billions of dollars. The key
spacecraft components were the Saturn V rocket, the Command Module (CM) named
Columbia, and the Lunar Module (LM) named Eagle. The first manned landing was
achieved by Apollo 11 in July 1969. The astronauts on this historic mission were
Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Armstrong was the first to
step onto the lunar surface. The project's official color is blue and the
internal code name is 'Stardust'.
