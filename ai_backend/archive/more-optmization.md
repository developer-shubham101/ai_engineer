Here are **high-impact, realistic upgrades** you can add to your project **next**, without breaking your architecture or requiring GPU/cloud APIs.
These are grouped into **Core RAG**, **Security**, **Support Chat**, **LLM Layer**, **DevOps**, and **Enterprise Features**.

---

# 🚀 **1. Core RAG Enhancements**


### ✅ **A. Relevance Re-ranking (Cross-encoder / MiniLM reranker)**

After Chroma returns top_k chunks, pass them through a **local reranker** to boost accuracy.

Works offline using:

* `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2`
* `bge-reranker-base` (if CPU ok)

**Impact:** much higher answer accuracy.

---

### ✅ **B. Auto-summarization of large chunks**

Before storing into Chroma:

* Summaries can be generated locally using your LLM
* Also store summary embeddings for fallback retrieval

---

### ✅ **C. Document versioning**

When re-uploading a document:

* Automatically create new version
* Maintain `active=true/false`
* Avoid duplicating chunks accidentally

---

### ✅ **D. Hybrid retrieval (keyword + vector)**

Implement:

* TF-IDF + vector
* BM25 + vector

Better for legal/technical text.

---

# 🔐 **2. Security + RBAC Enhancements**

### ✅ **E. Fine-grained access rules based on attributes**

Add support for:

* `classification_level`
* `region_restricted` (ex: EU-only)
* `expire_after_date`
* `requires_manager_access=true`

---

### ✅ **F. Redaction before LLM**

If chunk is partially confidential:

* Replace sensitive fields with [[REDACTED]]
* Keep rest of chunk visible

Great for HR & Legal data.

---

### ✅ **G. Audit logging (enterprise-style)**

Log:

* Who accessed what document
* Timestamp
* Purpose
* Whether content was filtered or redacted
* Fallbacks executed

---

# 💬 **3. Support Chat System Enhancements**

### ✅ **H. Persistent long-term memory (per session / per user)**

Keep:

* Preferences
* Past questions
* Previous task threads
* Known issues from support history

---

### ✅ **I. Assistant personality modes**

Based on `profile.role`:

* HR mode
* IT support mode
* Finance mode
* Legal mode
* Manager mode

Each mode loads different prefixed behavior.

---

### ✅ **J. Conversation continuation after restart**

Right now your support chat keeps short-term history.

Add:

* `/session/resume`
* Restore last conversation state
* Allow multi-day debugging & chats

---

### ✅ **K. User sentiment / tone detection (local classifier)**

Simple offline BERT classifier that detects:

* Angry user
* Confused user
* Happy user

LLM adjusts tone accordingly.

---

# 🧠 **4. LLM Layer Upgrades**

### ✅ **L. Model auto-selection / routing**

Use smaller model for simple tasks:

* Summarization
* Classification
* Tagging
* Intent detection

Use Mistral only for heavy reasoning.

---

### ✅ **M. Offline fine-tuning / LoRA**

Train your model locally on:

* Your policies
* Your workflows
* HR/IT knowledge base

Even small LoRA improves performance a lot.

---

### ✅ **N. Local embedding model switch**

Support:

* bge-small-en
* nomic-embed-text
* gte-small

Some are faster/better on CPU.

---

### ✅ **O. Prompt caching**

Store:

* Previous LLM outputs
* Recent embeddings
* Common prefix structures

Reduces latency significantly.

---

# 🧩 **5. API / System Layer Enhancements**

### ✅ **P. API Request Validation**

Reject:

* Too-large inputs
* Too many requests per session
* Malformed requests

(Field-level validation with Pydantic.)

---

### ✅ **Q. Explainability endpoint**

Add:
`/rag/explain`

Returns:

* Which chunks were selected
* Why each chunk was chosen
* Similarity scores
* RBAC filtering results
* Token-budget results

This is great for debugging.

---

### ✅ **R. Background ingestion queue**

Handle big PDF ingestion without blocking FastAPI threads.

Use:

* Celery
* FastAPI background tasks

---

### ✅ **S. Configurable retrieval strategies**

Allow user to choose:

* `"hybrid"`
* `"dense"`
* `"keyword"`
* `"rerank_dense"`

---

# 🏢 **6. Enterprise-Grade Features**

### ✅ **T. Dynamic KB dashboards (HTML endpoints)**

Add a simple web UI:

* Upload documents
* View indexing results
* Test queries
* See session profiles

---

### ✅ **U. Department dashboards**

Show:

* HR knowledge base health
* IT troubleshooting doc coverage
* Finance FAQs

---

### ✅ **V. Automatic ticket creation**

If user issue unresolved after N messages:

* Auto create ticket
* Save in sqlite
* Return ticket_id

---

### ✅ **W. Analytics**

Track:

* Most used documents
* Top errors
* Most asked queries
* Department distribution

Stores into SQLite.

---

# 🔥 **7. EXTRA (High-Value, Low-Work Additions)**

### ⭐ **X. Query Reformulation**

Use a small local model to rewrite the question → more effective retrieval.

### ⭐ **Y. Retrieval fallback paths**

If no chunks found:

* Use onboarding profile to refine search
* Generate synthetic query expansions
* Try different embedding models

### ⭐ **Z. Autonomous routing**

Let the assistant decide:

* Whether to run RAG
* Or run a direct LLM answer
* Or ask a follow-up question

---

# 🎯 Summary — What can we add next?

Here are **top 5 improvements** you should actually do next (practical + high impact):

1. **Local reranker** (big accuracy jump)
2. **Explainability endpoint `/rag/explain`**
3. **Auto profile-based routing (HR mode, IT mode, etc.)**
4. **Prompt caching**
5. **Analytics + document usage metrics**
