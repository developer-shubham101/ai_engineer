## 🎯 Your Custom AI Engineer Roadmap

### Goal:

Become a **Production-Ready AI Engineer** — skilled in **LLM integration**, **AI workflows**, and **intelligent copilots**.

We’ll go through **5 Phases** + a **Capstone Project**, each with:

* Core Concepts
* Hands-on Skills
* Mini Projects / Challenges

---

# 🧭 Phase 1: Modern Python for AI Engineering (2–3 weeks)

**Objective:**
Transition from Python scripting to building **modular, API-driven AI backends**.

### 📘 Topics

* Python best practices for large projects (env, structure, typing)
* Asynchronous programming (async/await)
* Using APIs & handling auth (requests, httpx, aiohttp)
* JSON, Pydantic models, and data validation
* Intro to **FastAPI** and building REST endpoints
* Dockerize a simple Python + FastAPI app

### 🧑‍💻 Mini Projects

1. **API Wrapping Exercise** – Build a FastAPI wrapper around a public API (e.g., GitHub, Weather, or OpenAI).
2. **Async Task Runner** – Create an app that fetches multiple API responses concurrently.
3. **Containerization Challenge** – Dockerize and run your FastAPI app locally.

---

# 🤖 Phase 2: Working with Pre-trained LLMs (3–4 weeks)

**Objective:**
Learn to use **OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain** to integrate and orchestrate LLMs.

### 📘 Topics

* OpenAI API (Chat Completions, Responses, Tokens)
* Hugging Face Transformers (`pipeline`, `AutoModel`, etc.)
* LangChain basics (PromptTemplate, Chains, Agents)
* Understanding embeddings, context windows, and token limits
* Using tools: Ollama, LiteLLM, and local models

### 🧑‍💻 Mini Projects

1. **ChatGPT-style CLI bot** using OpenAI’s API
2. **Custom summarizer** using Hugging Face models
3. **LangChain Chain Builder** – Create a chain that takes a URL, extracts text, and answers questions about it.

---

# 🧠 Phase 3: Building Chatbots, Copilots & AI Agents (4–5 weeks)

**Objective:**
Learn how to **build structured LLM-powered systems** that remember, reason, and act.

### 📘 Topics

* Prompt engineering & system prompt design
* Memory & conversation management
* Function calling & tool use (OpenAI functions, LangChain Tools)
* Multi-agent architectures (LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen)
* Integrating with third-party APIs (Slack, Gmail, Jira, etc.)
* Orchestrating workflows via events and async calls

### 🧑‍💻 Mini Projects

1. **Smart Customer Support Bot** – Connect to a FAQ knowledge base.
2. **Developer Copilot** – Uses OpenAI + LangChain to suggest API code snippets.
3. **AI Workflow Agent** – Takes a task (“prepare report”) and performs subtasks using multiple models.

---

# 🧩 Phase 4: Memory, Embeddings & Vector Databases (3–4 weeks)

**Objective:**
Enable **contextual intelligence** using embeddings and long-term memory.

### 📘 Topics

* What embeddings are and how they’re generated
* Semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* Vector databases: FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate
* Indexing and retrieval optimization
* Document loaders (PDF, CSV, JSON)
* Building contextual memory for chatbots

### 🧑‍💻 Mini Projects

1. **Personal Knowledge Base Chatbot** – Upload PDF, ask questions from it.
2. **Employee Policy Assistant** – Store company docs in ChromaDB, query them using embeddings.
3. **RAG System Challenge** – Compare retrieval accuracy between FAISS and Pinecone.

---

# 🚀 Phase 5: Deploying & Scaling AI Applications (3–4 weeks)

**Objective:**
Take your AI system from local development → production-ready deployment.

### 📘 Topics

* FastAPI + LangChain backend design
* Streamlit or Next.js front-end for AI apps
* Docker Compose for multi-service setup
* CI/CD with GitHub Actions
* Hosting (Render, Hugging Face Spaces, AWS Lambda)
* API security, rate limiting, and monitoring

### 🧑‍💻 Mini Projects

1. **Deploy your chatbot** on Render or Hugging Face Spaces.
2. **Containerized AI Microservice** – Build a modular AI backend that other systems can call.
3. **Secure & Monitor Your API** – Add authentication and logging.

---

# 🏁 Capstone Project: **AI Copilot for Your Organization**

**Goal:**
Build a fully functional, production-ready **AI Copilot** that serves as a knowledge + task automation assistant for your org.

### 💡 Features

* Private LLM knowledge base (docs, policies, employee data)
* Natural language Q&A interface
* Workflow automation (ticket creation, HR queries, etc.)
* Memory persistence via vector DB
* Deployed via FastAPI + Streamlit or custom UI
* Dockerized, documented, and API-accessible

### 🧠 Tech Stack

OpenAI GPT / Hugging Face LLM + LangChain + ChromaDB + FastAPI + Docker + Streamlit

---

# 📘 Continuous Reinforcement

After each phase:

* I’ll give you **practical coding challenges**
* You’ll get **1 “Build-it-yourself” micro project**
* You’ll maintain an **AI Engineer Portfolio Repo** (public GitHub)

Would you like me to now:

1. Create the **Phase 1 detailed curriculum** (with daily/weekly plan, exercises, and GitHub-style project structure),
   or
2. Create a **visual roadmap diagram + summary sheet** (for quick reference and tracking)?

You can have both eventually — which one would you like to start with?
